# 📱 Augmented Reality Mobile Application

**Augmented Reality Mobile Application** is a mobile app that leverages AR technology to provide interactive experiences for users.  
It can overlay digital content (3D models, animations, information) onto the real world using the device’s camera, offering immersive learning, gaming, or visualization applications.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **AR Object Placement**: Place 3D models in the real world using the device camera.  
- **Interactive Animations**: Users can interact with AR objects (rotate, scale, move).  
- **Information Overlay**: Display contextual information on real-world objects.  
- **Marker-based and Markerless AR**: Supports both AR tracking modes for flexibility.  
- **Cross-platform Support**: Works on Android and iOS devices.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

### ⚙️ Backend (Optional)
- **Spring Boot**: API backend for user data, AR content, and analytics.  
- **Cloudinary / AWS S3**: Hosting 3D models and multimedia assets.  
- **MySQL / PostgreSQL**: Store user profiles, AR sessions, and app data.  

### 📱 Frontend / Mobile
- **Unity3D + AR Foundation**: Cross-platform AR development.  
- **Vuforia / ARCore / ARKit**: AR tracking and object detection.  
- **C# / Unity Scripting**: Interactivity and app logic.  
- **Mobile UI Frameworks**: For menus, dashboards, and settings.

## 🔐 Security
- Secure API endpoints using **JWT** (if backend exists).  
- Encrypted storage of user preferences and sensitive data.  
- Validate AR content sources to prevent malicious injections.
